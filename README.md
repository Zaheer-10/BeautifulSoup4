BeautifulSoup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.
# Project Title
BeautifulSoup4 is a Python library for scraping data from HTML and XML files. It allows you to easily navigate, search, and modify the parse tree using Pythonic idioms.
# Installation/Prerequisites
To install BeautifulSoup4, you can use pip or easy_install:
bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
or
```bash
easy_install beautifulsoup4
```
You also need a parser library that BeautifulSoup4 can work with. You can use the built-in Python parser (`html.parser`) or other third-party parsers, such as `lxml` or `html5lib`. For example, to install `lxml`, you can use:

```bash
pip install lxml
```

# FAQ
Some frequently asked questions about BeautifulSoup4 are:

- How do I specify a parser? You can specify a parser when you create a BeautifulSoup object, by passing the parser name as the second argument. For example: `soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "lxml")`
- How do I prettify the output? You can use the `prettify()` method on a BeautifulSoup object or a tag to get a nicely formatted string of the HTML. For example: `print(soup.prettify())`
- How do I get the text from a tag? You can use the `text` or `get_text()` method on a tag to get the text content of the tag and its children. For example: `print(soup.title.text)`
- How do I find a specific tag or tags? You can use the `find()` or `find_all()` methods on a BeautifulSoup object or a tag to search for a tag or tags that match certain criteria. For example: `soup.find("p", class_="story")` will find the first `<p>` tag with class "story".
